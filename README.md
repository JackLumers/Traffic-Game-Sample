# Traffic-Game-Sample
A 3d game sample that was made as a test task project.

# Project installation:
- Clone git repo => Enter playmode from **TrafficGameScene**.
- To delete save file go to **TrafficGame/ScriptableObjects/LevelModel** and click **Delete Save** from the context menu. Also click **Reset** if you need to reset values to default.

# Known bugs:
- ~~Cars can be spawned on top of each other after save load.~~ FIXED.
- ~~Car that stops right behind car that enters finish zone, don't starts move after.~~ FIXED.

Already took a good amount of time on this, so decided to leave it as it is for now. 
MVP pattern not implemented perfectly so I will research to make a better approach and
will fix mentioned bugs later.
