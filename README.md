# Traffic-Game-Sample
Sample game using MVP pattern, UniTasks and Addressable assets.

Project installation:
- Clone git repo => Enter playmode from **TrafficGameScene**.
- To delete save file go to **TrafficGame/ScriptableObjects/LevelModel** and click *Delete Save* in context menu.

Known bugs:
- Cars can be spawned on top of each other after save load.
- Car that stops right behind car that enters finish zone, don't starts move after.

Already took a good amount of time on this, so decided to leave it as it is for now. 
Will fix mentioned bugs and refactor later.
